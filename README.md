I wrote a toy example of sports analytics implemented the course 1 and 2 material. The analysis used data vitalization techniques and t-test.  link: https://github.com/LidingLi/Applied-data-science-specialization/blob/master/course2-applied-plotting-charting-data-representation-in-python/tennis-atp-data-analysis/Analysis%20of%20Performance%20of%20Kei%20Nishikori.ipynb

For course 3, there's an example of the process of building a random forest model, which includes cleaning training set, parameter tuning, plotting ROC curve and predicting positive probability for testing set.

For course 4, check another repository for details of Naive Bayes for text classification. Link: https://github.com/LidingLi/Numerical-Method/blob/master/Text-mining%20basics/Naive_bayes_spam_text.pdf
Also, check descriptions of LDA model for topic modeling on wiki. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation

For course 5, check  another repository for details of PageRank. https://github.com/LidingLi/Numerical_Method/blob/master/programming%20assignments/mp3_Page_Rank.ipynb
The normalized PageRank introduces a dampling factor that allows the walker to either choose an edge or a node to follow. The algorithm is typically useful in large number of webpages. https://github.com/LidingLi/Applied-data-science-specialization/blob/master/course5-applied-social-network-analysis/normalized_PageRank.py
