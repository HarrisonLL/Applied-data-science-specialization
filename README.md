There's a toy example of sports analytics implemented the course 1 and 2 material. The analysis used data vitalization techniques and t-test.  link: https://github.com/LidingLi/Applied-data-science-specialization/blob/master/course2-applied-plotting-charting-data-representation-in-python/tennis-atp-data-analysis/Analysis%20of%20Performance%20of%20Kei%20Nishikori.ipynb

For course 3, there's an example of the process of building a random forest model, which includes cleaning training set, parameter tuning, plotting ROC curve and predicting positive probability for testing set.
