- I wrote a toy example of sports analytics implemented the course 1 and 2 material. The [analysis](https://github.com/LidingLi/Applied-data-science-specialization/blob/master/course2-applied-plotting-charting-data-representation-in-python/tennis-atp-data-analysis/Analysis%20of%20Performance%20of%20Kei%20Nishikori.ipynb) used data vitalization techniques and t-test 

- For course 3, there's an [example](https://github.com/LidingLi/Applied-data-science-specialization/blob/master/course3-applied-machine-learning-in-python/Assignment%2B4.ipynb) of the process of building a random forest model, which includes cleaning training set, parameter tuning, plotting ROC curve and predicting positive probability for testing set. 

- For course 4, check [another repository](https://github.com/LidingLi/Numerical-Method/blob/master/Text-mining%20basics/Naive_bayes_spam_text.pdf) for details of Naive Bayes for text classification. Also, check descriptions of LDA model for topic modeling on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation)

- For course 5, check  another [repository](https://github.com/LidingLi/Numerical_Method/blob/master/programming%20assignments/mp3_Page_Rank.ipynb) for details of PageRank. 
The [normalized PageRank](https://github.com/LidingLi/Applied-data-science-specialization/blob/master/course5-applied-social-network-analysis/normalized_PageRank.py) introduces a dampling factor that allows the walker to either choose an edge or a node to follow. The algorithm is typically useful in large number of webpages.
